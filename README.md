This should be a working repo. Please don't introduce any breaking changes. Submit pull requests when you want to commit code.

Current working routes are:

/
/registerdid
/vehicleregistration
/jurisdictionregistration


Needed:

* Finish implementing vehicle registration and assign a DID to vehicles on the map, and have slashing when boundaries are crossed (Jason)
* Add read, update and delete functionality to the registerdid page (Tony). 'Create' aspect is already complete.
* Error messages/error handling (anyone)
* Implement loading spinners when waiting for results (Tony?)
* Populate forms for jurisdiction registration and interaction (John?)
* If there are multiple jurisdictions perhaps we should have a map for each one, or just 4 maps on one page if it looks good
* General styling of forms and pages to look nicer
* UNIT TESTS! (Someone, please)
